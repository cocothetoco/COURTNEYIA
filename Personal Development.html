                    Bring your goals to reality by writing them down so your mind can be aware of them. Write your small goals that lead up to the big goal. "The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it."

                <p>
                    The people you surround yourself with affect your attitude. Surrounmd yourself with hardworking, successful people you can learn from; people who can help you to graw as an individual. Ask yourself if the people you surround yourself with are people who will make yoru life better and people you will speak to 5 years down the line.

                    The two types of pain explained in this chapter. Pain of regrets and pain of dicipline. Pain of regrets weighs more because you lost your chance of doing something that could have been great. Pain of dicipline is when you take the chance and learn a lesson from it. Instead of procrastinating usse your time wisely because you will never be able to get time back.

                <p>

                    What you teach yourself in life is the key to success. Constantly improving your persona is very important. Observe successful people , take notes, reflect on your, adapt and adjust. Book are powerful learning tools. "It isn't what the book costs, it's what it will cost you if you don't record it."

                    The 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th pillars can be applied to life by reflecting on my life and apply them where needed. Based on personal reflection pillar 4 "Achieve your Goals" and pillar 6 "Surround yourself with the best people" stood out the most. In 2020 I learnt to write my goals and macro goals down in order to remember them and work towards them. I would tick off a goal everytime I achieve it. I am currently learning how to surround myself with good people. I realized that the people I surround myself with influence my choices so I started reflecting and removing all the people that has a bad or toxic influence on  my life.
